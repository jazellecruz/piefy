# Piefy - URL Shortener

[Piefy](https://piefy.vercel.app) is a URL Shortener made with Node.js and PostgreSQL. This was created as a personal project to learn how a URL shortening service works.

****Note***: Since this was intended as a personal project, the shortened url generated is not exactly "short". The project is hosted only for free in Vercel, so the domain name is a default one.*
